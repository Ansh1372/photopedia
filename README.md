# Photopedia - Photography Club MJPRU Bareilly
The word Photography literally means â€˜drawing with lightâ€™, which derives from the Greek photo, meaning light and graph, meaning to draw. Photography is the process of recording an image â€“ a photograph â€“ on lightsensitive film or, in the case of digital photography, via a digital electronic or magnetic memory.

The photograph is evident in nearly every aspect of modern life. As a form of communication and documentation, photographs are present in newspapers, magazines, advertisements, posters, television, the Internet, passports, ID cards, archives, security and Surveillance Systems, forensics and medicine. Photography also plays an important role in domestic and recreational activities.

### What I learned

- In this project i majourly learned about different type of CSS properties flexbox and sweaping feature of javascript:

```html
<h1>Some HTML code I'm proud of</h1>
<span>Never Stop</span>
                        <h3>exploring</h3>
                        <p>Life is like a camera.
                            Just focus on what's 
                            important and capture 
                            the good times,develop
                            from the negatives,and if
                            things don't work out 
                            just take another shot.!</p>
```
```css
.proud-of-this-css {
  #zoomA {
 
  width: 100%;
  height: 100%;
  transition: transform ease-in-out 0.3s;
}
 
#zoomA:hover { transform: scale(1.2); 
  }
.team .slide {

  border: solid #10221b  ;
}
}
```
```js
const proudOfThisFunc = () => {
  window.onscroll = () =>{
    navbar.classList.remove('active');

    if(window.scrollY > 0){
        document.querySelector('.header').classList.add('active');
    }else{
        document.querySelector('.header').classList.remove('active');
    }
};
  console.log('ðŸŽ‰')
}
```


### Continued development
- After this project we start learnig new CSS/JS liberies and framework link Jquery , AOS , GSAP to make this site more efficient and more userfriendly , and more animeted.
